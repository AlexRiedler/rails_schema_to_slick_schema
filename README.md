rails_schema_to_slick_schema
============================

Simple Script that loads a db/schema.rb file from rails and produces scala slick objects as the result. (WIP)

Intentions
===========

+ To be a synchronization script between a rails environment and a scala environment that would
run before deployment to create all Scala Table objects

+ Allow access to rails database models in scala without much effort

+ Support companies moving from Rails backed to Scala backend (cause who does not like speed)


Use
===

Copy the `slick_convert.rb` file to your local rails directory and run
`ruby slick_convert.rb`
It will produce the object definitions to standard output
